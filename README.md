# playlist-in-linkedlist
This is C++ implementation for creating a music playlist application. The playlist needs to allow users to manage their songs efficiently using a linked list data structure. Your application should support the following operations:
 Insert a Song: Allow users to add a new song at the beginning, end, or any specific position in the playlist.
 Delete a Song: Allow users to remove a song from the beginning, end, or any specific position in the playlist.
Display the Playlist: Show the current order of songs in the playlist.
